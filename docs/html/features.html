<H3>Multiple Package Archives</H3>

<P>Opt_depot now supports multiple package archives. This means that opt_link
is able to scan several archive directories looking for software to link
into the depot directory. The archives may be ordered into a prioritized
hierarchy.</P>

<P>See the <A HREF="opt_link2.0.html">opt_link 2.0</A> page for more details</P>

<H3>Dynamic Exclusion Handling in opt_link</H3>

<P>Because the new version of opt_link calculates exclusions at run time,
the primary .exclude file no longer has to contain past exclusions -- only
current exclusions need to be present, making it considerably easier to
manage.</P>

<H3>Recursive linking and cleaning</H3>

<P>Opt_depot and opt_clean have been modified to create sub-directories
under /bin/lib/include/info/man to help deal with file conflicts. If two
packages have files that share a common directory. and if these files both
have clearance to be linked by opt_depot, then opt_depot will create a
sub-directory so that both packages can have links to both package's files
built.</P>

<P>Before, earlier versions of opt_depot could only build links to a single
package's files in the case of file conflicts.</P>

<H3>Setup.sh</H3>

<P>A shell script has been developed to help facilitate the process of
installing opt_depot on the system. The setup program is designed to support
several types of environments, ranging a home linux setup to the situation
where the opt_depot scripts are shared access an entire network.</P>

<P>Opt_depot now uses a common configuration file to provide the locations
of the depot, software base and log directory. This file, called opt.config,
can be created by the setup.sh script. Setup.sh also calls the modify_archives
utility program, which helps create and maintain the `sites' file that
is used by opt_link.</P>

<H3>Fluffy</H3>

<P>Where would opt_depot be without an official mascot? </P>

<P><A HREF="fluffy.html">Fluffy</A> represents the best and worst in all
opt_depot developers; it is an extension of our highest aprirations and
our basest desires. </P>

<P>May the grace of Fluffy guide and protect you in your journey through
the ever-changing world of opt_depot.</P>
