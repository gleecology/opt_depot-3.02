<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>Software management in a UNIX&nbsp;environment has always been one of
the more tedious and frustrating tasks confronting a systems administrator.
Keeping track of the numerous file dependencies and path requirements imposed
by software vendors, testing new programs, maintaining current ones, and
surgically removing the correct files when a piece of software is no longer
in use: all these problems add considerably to the overall administrative
workload.</P>

<P>In a networked system the situation is further compounded by the sheer
amount of software that must be maintained and from having to address the
conflicting needs of multiple users.</P>

<P>Opt_depot helps ameliorate the situation by providing administrators
with a tool that allows them to organize the files needed to run a piece
of software into discrete<I> packages,</I> and to keep them physically
separate from one another. Software is installed into packages by the system
administrator and opt_depot then manages a set of symbolic links to make
the software accessible to the end-users PATH, MANPATH and library path
variables.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3>Software Packages</H3>

<P>When using opt_depot, software must be installed in a hierarchical structure
known as a &quot;package&quot;. Installing software in this form involves
breaking down the program into its component files and placing them into
sub-directories based on their content. There are several benefits to using
a packaging system:</P>

<P>First, it clarifies installation by allowing different software programs
to be kept in separate locations while maintaining the same overall directory
structure. For example, if you have multiple packages you can be assured
that any executables can be found underneath the /bin subdirectory of each
package. </P>

<P>Second, this system makes it easy to remove a piece of installed software.
Because the packages reside apart from one another, there is no need to
keep track of which files belong to a given program. The packaging system
insures that the files needed by a piece of software will always be located
in its own sub-directories.</P>

<P>Finally, software is able to run from a different location than where
it actually resides. Because the package structure complies with the typical
pathnames used for running a piece of software, the program may be compiled
to run from a certain location and then placed elsewhere. When installing
the package a symbolic link to that package may be placed in a separate
directory, effectively installing the software from that location.</P>

<P>The following diagram illustrates a typical package: </P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/package.gif" HEIGHT=285 WIDTH=529></P>

<P>Here, directories are represented by ovals and individual files by rectangles.
The emacs-19.34 directory contains bin, info, man, com and share sub-directories.
All the emacs files are divied up into these directories based on their
nature; bin/ contains the executables, while GNU information and documentation
is placed in info/, etc. </P>

<P>By default, opt_depot would not make symbolic links under the com/ and
share/ directories listed because the files in these directories shouldn't
need to be accessed by anything other than the package itself. Creating
directories like com/ and share/ is perfectly acceptable and often adds
to the level of organization within the software package.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3>Software&nbsp;Linking</H3>

<P>Even though software is stored in discrete packages, it should appear
to the user that every piece of software is kept in the same location.
Using symbolic links instead of accessing the software directly lets the
user to specify a single directory in his or her PATH variables to access
all the publicly available software on the system.</P>

<P>To accomplish this task, a software base directory is set up that contains
/bin, /lib, /man, /include, and /info sub-directories, and within these
sub-directories there are symbolic links to the /bin, /lib, /man, /include,
and /info subdirectories of each package that is installed in a single
directory called the depot directory. These directories can be used for
direct installation as well; opt_depot can manage links in an existing
directory without conflict.</P>

<P>However, conflicts can arise when the same files are found in two or
more packages (e.g. X11R5 and X11R6). Opt_depot uses a file called <A HREF="glossary.html#priority">.priority</A>
to help resolve these conflicts. What <I>.priority </I>does is spell out
the precedence relationships among certain files, helping to ensure that
the correct files are linked. It is a plain text file that by default is
located under the software base directory, and it lists files and package
names line by line. When there is a file name conflict, the .priority file
is scanned and the package or file appearing first wins out. If neither
file or package appears in the .priority file then conflict is resolved
by leaving the current link in place.</P>

<P>Of course, there must also be a mechanism in place for removing installed
packages, and for testing out new versions of software. Opt_depot uses
exclusion files to determine which packages should be un-installed. If
a package or individual file is listed in the <A HREF="glossary.html#.exclude">primary
<I>.exclude</I></A> file, no links to it will be built and any existing
links will be removed. By default this file should be located under the
software base directory. </P>

<P>In addition, each packge may have its own <A HREF="glossary.html#per-exclude">per-package
exclusion file</A> so that it may exclude any earlier versions that should
not be linked in.</P>

<P>This diagram shows links going from the software base directory to two
packages: netscape-4.0 and emacs-19.33. netscape-4.0 physically resides
in the depot directory, whereas emacs-19.33 is in fact a symbolic link
pointing to the emacs-19.33 package that resides the the package archives.
Note also that emacs-19.30 is excluded and is not available from the depot
directory.</P>

<H3>Opt_depot's directory structure</H3>

<P>Opt_depot provides a great deal of flexibility with respect to the nomenclature
of the various directories opt_depot uses. The following table lists examples
from our own opt_depot setup here at ARL, and the function that each directory
serves:</P>

<H3>The Functions of each opt_depot script</H3>

<P>The opt_depot suite consists of five component pieces, each with its
own specialized functions. Some of the functions, like those performed
by the opt_depot script, are integral to the overall operations the opt_depot
suite was designed to perform. The rest are tools used for managing the
other opt_depot scripts. Here's a breakdown:</P>

<CENTER><P><I>The Big Three - Scripts that carry out the linking functions
of opt_depot.</I></P></CENTER>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">opt_depot</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE=+1> </FONT>-
This script is the core of the opt_depot suite. It is responsible for creating
and maintaining links from the sub-directories contained in the software
base directory to the sub-directories in each software package located
in the depot directory. </P>

<P><B><I>opt_clean </I></B>- opt_clean removes links to files that are
non-existent or that have been excluded by the .exclude file. </P>

<P><B><I>opt_link</I></B> - In a networked environment, opt_link creates
symbolic links going from the depot directory to software packages located
in separate software package archives. This allows packages to be compiled
to run in the depot directory regardless of their actual location. </P>

<CENTER><P><I>The Other Two - Scripts that help manage the opt_depot suite
itself</I></P></CENTER>

<P><B><I>opt_setup </I></B>- Invokes opt_link, opt_depot and opt_clean
with a single command. The purpose of this script is to automate the opt_depot
process by llowing it to run from chron. </P>

<P><B><I>opt_nuke </I></B>- Acts as a self-destruct switch. The opt_nuke
script removes all the links that were created by opt_depot.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3>Files used by opt_depot </H3>

<P>There are several files that allow the opt_depot suite to run smoothly.
The first two, opt.config and sites, are created by the setup.sh program
when opt_depot is installed on the system. The others must be created by
the system administrator.</P>

<P><B><I><A HREF="install.html">opt.config</A></I></B> - This configuration
file is created by the <I>setup.sh</I><FONT COLOR="#191970"> </FONT>installation
program. The file provides the opt_depot scripts with the locations of
the &quot;depot&quot;, &quot;software base&quot; and &quot;log&quot; directories.
</P>

<P><B><I><A HREF="glossary.html#sites">sites</A></I></B> - The sites file
contains the names and locations of the package archives. Also, the sites
file may contains implicit prioritization of multiple package archives.
See the <A HREF="opt_link2.0.html#sites">opt_link 2.0 page</A> for more
details. </P>

<P><B><I><A HREF="glossary.html#priority">.priority</A></I></B> - When
opt_depot creates the links from the software base directory to the packages
contained in the depot directory, file conflicts often arise. One method
for dealing with these conflicts is by creating a .priority file, which
gives percedence to selected files. </P>

<P><A HREF="glossary.html#.exclude">.<B><I>exclude</I></B></A> <I>(including
<A HREF="glossary.html#per-exclude">per-package exclusion </A>files) -
</I>The .exclude file is used by opt_depot and opt_link un-install packages
or individual files. If a file or package-name is listed in the master
.exclude file, then its links will not be made or will be removed. In addition,
each individual package has the option of having its own .exclude file
as well, so a new version of a package can easily supersede the older version
simply by having the older version listed in its .exclude file.</P>
