<H3><A NAME="archive"></A>Central Package Archive</H3>

<P>The Central Package Archive is any location where packages are physically
installed for remote access via NFS. These packages are linked into the
Local Depot Directory by opt_link for access by opt_depot. The Central
Package Archive contains a set of subdirectories, one for each package
that you wish to provide access to. Each package should contain a bin directory,
a lib directory (if appropriate), include, man, man/manl, etc. Basically
each package is a miniature /usr/local unto itself. </P>

<P>At ARL:UT we have /v/site/os in addition to /v/site/packages, for software
that we want to make available to our NFS clients, but which we want users
to have to take affirmative action to make local copies that will be available
even if the Central Package Archive server is not available. </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="per-exclude"></A>Per-Package Exclusion Files</H3>

<P>Packages in the Central Package Archive may contain .exclude files,
allowing packages to exclude earlier versions of itself or other packages.
The easiest way to update software on the network is to add the currently
installed version of the software package to the new package's own <I>.exclude</I>
file. The current links to the older version will be removed and the new
package will be given clearance to be installed.</P>

<P>A per-package exclusion file for netscape-4.0 might look something like
this:</P>

<PRE>  netscape-2.0
  netscape-3.01b1
  netscape-3.01b2
  netscape-3.01

</PRE>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="depot"></A>Depot Directory</H3>

<P>This directory will be where all software installed through opt_depot
is configured to run from. Each system you want to run client off of opt_depot
should have its own copy of this directory. </P>

<P>On our system, this directory is called /opt/depot. We install our software
so that packages look for their files under /opt/depot/&lt;packagename&gt;.
For instance, we compile GNU Emacs 19.29 so that it expects to see its
files under /opt/depot/emacs-19.29/{bin|lib|include|info} and so forth.
</P>

<P>The opt_link script will make symbolic links from your Local Depot Directory
to your Central Package Archive. Once this is done, the opt_depot script
will make symbolic links in your Local Base Directory, which is where user's
paths (PATH, MANPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH) will find the software that you
install. </P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="base"></A>Software Base Directory</H3>

<P>This is the directory that will contain the bin, man, lib, include,
and info directories that you want opt_depot to manage. In our case, we
have opt_depot managing /opt. Opt_depot can work cooperatively with files
already existing in /opt/{bin|man| lib|include|info}. Opt_depot will add
and remove symbolic links from these directories as appropriate for the
packages that you install or remove. The Base Directory need not be in
any special place relative to your Local Depot Directory, but the Local
Depot Directory must be in the same location across all systems using your
packages. </P>

<P>The Base Directory can contain .exclude and .priority files which are
used to exclude unwanted pieces of software and to specify how conflicts
will be resolved during the opt_depot linking process, respectively. </P>

<P>The man pages, diagrams and documentation that come with the tar file
explain things in detail. </P>

<P>The main thing you have to remember is that you must compile and install
your software so that it will look for its files through &lt;Local Depot
Directory&gt;/&lt;PackageName&gt;. This is what gives the packages position
independence, and allows you the choice of installing locally or on a Central
Package Archive. </P>

<P>

<H3><A NAME=".exclude"></A>Exclusion File</H3>

<P>Opt_depot allows the system administrator to remove installed software
packages through the use of a <B><I>.exclude</I></B> file. This file contains
a list of packages that opt_depot and opt_link will ignore -- that is to
say no package contained in the .exclude file will have links to it built
by opt_depot or opt_link. opt_clean will remove any links to packages listed
in the .exclude file.</P>

<P>Files included in the list can either start with the package name (e.g.
opt_depot/bin/opt_clean) or be absolute pathnames (e.g. /opt/depot/opt_depot/bin/opt_clean),
or be the the names of the packages themselves.</P>

<P>Package names should be the name of the package as listed under the
depot directory and should contain no slashes. Comments may follow a pound
sign placed at the beginning of a line. </P>

<P><I>Example </I>of a .exclude file:</P>

<PRE>   # I'm a .exclude file

   gcc-2.63
   netscape-1.0
   tcl
   /opt/depot/tiger/lib/c
   java-1.0/bin

</PRE>

<P><I>Location:</I> By default, opt_depot and opt_link look for the .exclude
file under the software base directory.</P>

<P><I><A HREF="#per-exclude">Per-Package Exclusions</A></I>: Each package
may have its own .exclude file that contains a list of any earlier, outdated
versions that should be excluded.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="priority"></A>Priority File</H3>

<P><B><I>.priority</I></B> is a list of packages and package files in order
of <I>decreasing</I> priority. It permits the user to specify which packages
or files are more important when name conflicts arise. </P>

<P>If two files conflict then the priority list is searched. If either
of the files or directories containing them are found then a comparison
is made to determine which is of higher priority. If a file or its package
is not contained in the priority list then it has the lowest priority.
If two files conflict and neither are found in the list then the first
one linked remains. </P>

<P>The format of<I> .priority</I> is the same as <I>.exclude</I>, meaning
that any files included in the list can either start with the package name
(e.g. opt_depot/bin/opt_clean) or be absolute pathnames (e.g. /opt/depot/opt_depot/bin/opt_clean),
or be the the names of the packages themselves, if you want to assign relative
priority of all files in a pair of packages. </P>

<P>Package names should be the name of the package as listed under the
depot directory and should contain no slashes. Comments may follow a pound
sign placed at the beginning of a line. </P>

<P>A typical .priority file might look something like this:</P>

<PRE>  # I'm the .priority file

  ghostscript-3.51
  xv-3.10a
  X11R6
  X11R5
  SUNWste/bin
  imsl/bin/
</PRE>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="sites"></A>Sites File</H3>

<P>One of the features introduced in opt_depot 2.0 is the addition of <I>multiple
</I>package archives. Administrators can now exercise the option of having
packages in several different locations be linked into the depot directory.
There are also several methods for prioritizing the separate archives.</P>

<P>Opt_link uses the sites file to specify the locations of the package
archives and their associated labels. Each entry in the sites file is in
the form of <I>&lt;label&gt; &nbsp;&lt;location of archive&gt;.</I></P>

<P>The labels are used for excluding packages from a specific package archive.
An entry in the .exclude file can have the form <I>&lt;label&gt;:&lt;package-name&gt;</I>,
which indicates that only the package from that specific labeled archive
should be excluded. </P>

<P><I>For Example,</I> say the following entries appear in the sites file:</P>

<DD><I>Global &nbsp;/v/site/packages</I></DD>

<DD><I>Local &nbsp;/usr/local/packages</I></DD>

<P>If you only want to exclude a particular version of netscape contained
in /v/site/packages, and a version of emacs contained in /usr/local/packages,
then you might include some entries in the exclude file that looked like
this:</P>

<PRE>
  # It's the .exclude file

  Global:netscape-4.0
  Local:emacs-19.33

</PRE>

<P><I>Quick syntax note</I>: When specifying a labeled exclusion a colon
must come between the label and the package-name, whereas there is only
whitespace between the label and the archive location in a sites file entry.</P>

<P><I>Location</I>: The default location of the sites file is under the
/etc subdirectory of the opt_depot package.</P>
