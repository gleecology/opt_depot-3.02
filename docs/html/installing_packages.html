<H3><A NAME="packages"></A>What Are Packages?</H3>

<P>A package is a directory containing all the files needed to use a piece
of software. Packages are typically installed on a lab-wide site volume,
and accessed by workstations through NFS. </P>

<P>Packages are designed to be position independent. In principle, a package
can be physically located anyplace, as long as a symbolic link exists from
<TT>/opt/depot/&lt;packagename&gt;</TT> to the physical location of the
package. The software in each package is configured so that it looks for
its associated files within the <TT>/opt/depot/&lt;packagename&gt;</TT>
directory.</P>

<P>Packages have a defined structure. Each package may contain a bin directory,
a lib directory, an include directory, an info directory, and a man directory.
Executable binary programs and scripts go in the bin directory, man pages
go into the man directory. If the package incorporates .h files that should
be available to software outside of the package, these .h files should
be placed in the include directory. Any libraries in the package that should
be available to the entire system should be located in the lib directory.
GNU programs may include .info files for documentation. These should be
placed in the info directory. </P>

<P>A package may contain any number of other directories or files.. these
other files and directories will not be integrated into the normal user
environment, but the package itself will make use of them as needed. </P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="packagename"></A>Choosing a Package Name</H3>

<P>Packages are named. The name of the package is the filename of the directory
containing the package. </P>

<P>Package names are typically of the form <TT>name-version</TT>, for instance
<TT>gcc-2.6.3</TT> or <TT>ncftp-2.0.2</TT>. The precise form of the package
name is not significant, but different versions of the package should be
given different package names. This ensures that when the time comes to
install a new version, it is possible to keep both versions of the package
around until all package users have had time to transition to the new version.
</P>

<P>The <B>opt_link</B> software has support for automating the transition
process as part of running <B>opt_setup</B>. See the section below on <A HREF="#versioning">Handling
Versioning</A> for more details. </P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="where"></A>Where to Build and Install Software?</H3>

<P>You should always plan on compiling and installing software on a system
of the appropriate type. At ARL, our site-wide package archives for SunOS
and Solaris are located on the same machine, a SparcCenter 2000 running
Solaris. In order to compile and install software for SunOS, it is necesary
to configure and build the software on a SunOS machine, then move it to
the 2000. </P>

<P>If the SunOS client machine has write access to the site volume, it
will suffice to su to root and follow the first procedure listed under
<A HREF="#preparing">Preparing the Software Base Directory</A>, below.
</P>

<P>If not, you will need to make a temporary directory on the SunOS client,
either directly in <TT>/opt/depot</TT>, or in some other location with
an appropriate symbolic link from <TT>/opt/depot/packagename</TT>. You
compile and install into <TT>/opt/depot/packagename</TT> as described below,
then make a tar file of the package's directory and transfer it to the
server using ftp, as follows: </P>

<PRE>        -- on the client --

        cd /opt/depot
        tar cvf /tmp/package.tar packagename
        ftp csdsun1
                login: root
                cd /site/SunOS4.1.3/packages
                binary
                lcd /tmp
                put package.tar
                quit
        rm /tmp/package.tar
        rm -rf packagename
        
        -- on the server --
        
        cd /site/SunOS4.1.3/packages
        tar xvf package.tar
        rm package.tar
</PRE>

<P>Note that in the above example, we remove the package from the local
<TT>/opt/depot</TT> directory. We are assuming that the client will use
the package installed on the server through NFS after we run <B>opt_setup</B>.
</P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="makefiles"></A>Configuring Makefiles</H3>

<P>If the software that you are installing comes from the GNU project,
there will typically be a configure program that is used to create the
makefiles for the program. </P>

<P>Typically, you can run configure as follows: </P>

<PRE>        configure --prefix=/opt/depot/packagename
</PRE>

<P>this will configure the software and makefiles so that when the software
is installed and run, the software will look for its files under <TT>/opt/depot/packagename</TT>.
</P>

<P>Software that doesn't use the GNU autoconfigure system will need to
have its makefiles modified by hand to work properly in the <B>opt_depot</B>
package environment. Often it is a simple matter of modifying the makefiles
to install the software with <TT>/opt/depot/packagename</TT> replacing
<TT>/usr/local</TT> wherever <TT>/usr/local</TT> occurs. </P>

<P>Additional steps may be necessary when modifying the makefiles. Makefiles
will often assume that the <TT>/usr/local/bin</TT>, <TT>/usr/local/lib</TT>,
<TT>/usr/local/include</TT>, and <TT>/usr/local/man</TT> directories already
exist. You will have to make the corresponding directories (i.e., <TT>bin</TT>,
<TT>lib</TT>, etc.) by hand under the package's main directory when you
actually go to install the software. </P>

<P>In general, you should make sure that any paths compiled into the software
should be pointing to a file under <TT>/opt/depot/packagename</TT>, and
that the makefiles will place the software in the appropriate directories
under <TT>/opt/depot/packagename</TT> when you go to install. </P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="preparing"></A>Preparing the Installation Directory</H3>

<P>Many software packages' build structures are designed so that the install
procedure will install the software and associated files into the location
that the software has been configured to expect to find itself. But since
we want to support location independence, what do you do if you don't actually
want the software to be physically located in <TT>/opt/depot/packagename</TT>?
In fact, normally you wouldn't install the software physically into <TT>/opt/depot</TT>,
but rather in some other directory accessed through NFS by client systems.
</P>

<P>The way to deal with this is to have a symbolic link pointing from <TT>/opt/depot/packagename</TT>
to the actual location of the software package, wherever it might be. The
<B>opt_link</B> script in the <B>opt_depot</B> software suite is designed
to build symbolic links connecting the <TT>/opt/depot</TT> directory to
a standard NFS server location where packages are kept. </P>

<P>This symbolic link must exist before you run the make install process.
When using the ARL site volume, the order of operations goes something
like this: </P>

<PRE>        su
        mkdir /v/site/packages/packagename
        opt_link -vx  -- this creates /opt/depot/packagename, linked to /v/site/packagename
        cd /opt/depot/packagename
        mkdir bin lib include man man/man1 (etc.)
</PRE>

<P>In this example above, we had to su in order to be able to write to
the NFS package archive accessed through /v/site/packages. If you are installing
software in a location other than the main package server, you may not
need to be root. Like this, say: </P>

<PRE>        mkdir /usr2/diskspace/packages/packagename
        ln -s /usr2/diskspace/packages/packagename /opt/depot/packagename
        cd /opt/depot/packagename
        mkdir bin lib include man man/man1 (etc.)
</PRE>

<P>You may also just install the software directly into /opt/depot: </P>

<PRE>        mkdir /opt/depot/packagename
        cd /opt/depot/packagename
        mkdir bin lib include man man/man1 (etc.)
</PRE>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="installing"></A>Installing the Software</H3>

<P>Once you have the <TT>/opt/depot/packagename</TT> directory prepared,
along with the necessary subdirectories, you should be able to just do
</P>

<PRE>        make
        make install
</PRE>

<P>it is usually a very good idea to keep logs of the build and installation
process.. you can do the following: </P>

<PRE>        make &gt;&amp;make.log &amp;
        tail -f make.log        -- view the output of make
        make install&gt;&amp;install.log &amp;
        tail -f install.log     -- view the output of the install
</PRE>

<P>in order to install the software. If the Makefile was configured properly,
all files associated with the package will be installed under <TT>/opt/depot/packagename</TT>.

<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="permissions"></A>Package Permissions</H3>

<P>You need to make sure that all files in the package are executable and
readable by everyone. You can guarantee that permissions are set appropriately
by executing the following commands: </P>

<PRE>        find /opt/depot/packagename -type f -exec chmod a+r {} \; -print
        find /opt/depot/packagename -perm -0100 -exec chmod a+rx {} \; -print
</PRE>

<P>This will make all files in the package readable by all, and all directories
and executable files executable by all. </P>

<P>If you are installing into the ARL site volume, you should set the ownership
of the package as follows: </P>

<PRE>        chown -R root /opt/depot/packagename
        chgrp -R other /opt/depot/packagename
</PRE>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="versioning"></A>Handling Versioning</H3>

<P>You will often find yourself needing to install a new version of a piece
of software that has already been installed. If you are installing the
new version on a single machine, either directly in the <TT>/opt/depot</TT>
directory, or in some other non-shared directory, you can just remove the
old version and install the new version. </P>

<P>For a shared package archive, it is not that simple. You can't just
remove the old version, because NFS clients of the package archive won't
notice the new software until their system administrators run <B>opt_setup</B>.
You have to keep the old version of the software around until all of the
client systems have a chance to notice the new software and replace the
links to the old software with links to the new software. </P>

<P><B>opt_link</B> allows clients to link new packages in favor of old
packages, but you have to set things up so that <B>opt_link</B> knows what
new packages should replace what old packages. </P>

<P>This is done by creating a file called <TT>.<B><I>exclude </I></B>in
</TT>the top level directory of a new package. This file should contain
a list of one or more packages that the new package should replace. For
instance, suppose that we are installing a new version of gcc. Say the
old package was called gcc-2.6.3, and our new package is called gcc-2.6.8.
We could create the following file <TT>.exclude </TT>in <TT>/opt/depot/gcc-2.6.8</TT>:
</P>

<PRE>        # this package replaces older versions of gcc
        gcc-2.6.3
        gcc-2.6.1
        gcc-2.5.8

</PRE>

<P>When the client systems next run <B>opt_setup</B>, <B>opt_link</B> will
scan the client's <TT>/opt/.exclude</TT> file, and add <TT>gcc-2.6.3</TT>
to it, as well as <TT>gcc-2.6.1</TT> and <TT>gcc-2.5.8</TT> (if they weren't
already listed in <TT>/opt/.exclude</TT>). </P>

<P>When opt_setup runs opt_clean, all the links to the newly excluded package
will be removed. opt_depot will then forge links to the new package. </P>

<P>After a reasonable amount of time, the old package can be removed from
the shared package archive entirely. </P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="documentation"></A>Documentation Procedures</H3>

<P>A record for each installed package must be entered into the database
of installed software. To do this, use the <A HREF="http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/csd/csdsdb/software_inst.html">documentation
procedures</A> for packages for use with <A HREF="http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/csd/csdsdb/main_desc.html">csdsdb</A>.
<BR>
<BR>
All packages should contain a file named <TT>ARLUT_README</TT> which gives
details as to who installed the software, when it was installed, information
about the software (version, purpose, source directory, ftp site, files
included, etc.) along with any extra notes that may be appropriate for
the package. <BR>
<BR>
The <TT>ARLUT_README</TT> file should be created with the <A HREF="http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/csd/csdsdb/main_desc.html">csdsdb</A>
software database using the methods outlined in the <A HREF="http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/csd/csdsdb/software_inst.html">documentation
procedures</A>. <BR>
<BR>
The <TT>ARLUT_README</TT> file should, of course, be world readable. </P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="integrating"></A>Integrating the Software into the Base directory
(/opt)</H3>

<P>Once you have the software installed in <TT>/opt/depot/packagename</TT>
with appropriate permissions and documentation, you should run <TT>opt_setup
-vm</TT> on all systems that will make use of the package. Most workstations
in the laboratory that are set to use the shared package archive will do
this automatically on a periodic basis. </P>
